#' Merge two dataframes
#'
#' `merge_df_df` merges a df and df with a inner join and checks if/what data would be lost in the right df
#'
#' @param df_left A dataframe (data.frame)
#' @param id_left The name of the column in df_left that will be used to merge (character)
#' @param df_right A dataframe (data.frame)
#' @param id_right The name of the column in df_right that will be used to merge (character)
#' @param cols_to_keep The columns that should be kept in the merged df (character vector)
